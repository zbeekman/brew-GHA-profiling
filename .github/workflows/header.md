# Profiling and default homebrew configuration in GitHub Actions

This page is used to post output generated by GitHub Actions on macOS to get the details of the homebrew setup
and to run profiling experiments on ways to try to speedup Homebrew on GitHub actions.

Currently, no posting/analysis is being done on the timing data collected during this workflow.
However, the CSV files with install times for the three packages are being tracked and updated.
These can be downloaded from the deployed webpage (https://izaakbeekman.com/brew-GHA-profiling) or
browsed and downloaded from the [`gh-pages` branch] of the main repository.

[`gh-pages` branch]: https://github.com/zbeekman/brew-GHA-profiling/tree/gh-pages
